- I need to make sure to sort all the generated posts according to their file name, rather than to sort them by their order of appearance in a folder (which is ordered by modification date). However, listing of tags should remain according to alphabetical order. Alas, it same with what I say previously!

- Some simple markdown syntax are still not working. Indentify and fix them

- Graphing functions needs improvements...

- Graph functions simply do not support (afaic) vectoral drawings. Could it be enhances easily?

- general code refactoring, documenting and simplifying go without saying...
