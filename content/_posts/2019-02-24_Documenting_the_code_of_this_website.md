One way to document the code writing literate code, which is a demanding task if done late.

Another more conventional alternative is writing the code according to the [style guidelines of the Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)

And then adding [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) commenting syntax to the code to generate documentation pages.

It is a less hard-core approach to code documenting compared to [literate coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).
