Implemented ideas are written with a gray color.

<<< html(`<ul style="color: gray;">

<li>  when writing a post, the header section items must be seperate input fields, allowing to switch them by 'tab' key... </li>

<li>  when writing a post, there should be a button for each special function to be able to include them quickly. When the button will be pressed, corresponding special function will be added to the end of the post writing box. And so I can easily fill the content of the special function without focusing on getting the syntax right. </li>

<li> Regex selection for special functions are currently include esc and end keyword. Replace them with something better like double curly brackets. </li>

<li> Graph functions should support hot reload </li>

<li> List of tags should dissappear when user enter an input, thus limiting the possible options of tags.</li>


</ul>`) >>>


- related to styling, it seems to be more reasonable to use [semantic-ui](https://semantic-ui.com/) rather than bootstrap.

- Some simple markdown syntax are still not working. Indentify and fix them

- Graphing functions needs improvements...
- inline rendering for code snippets and math expression are not working. Fix them. 
- HTML white space entity is persisting when there is a white space between grave marks...

- general code refactoring, documenting and simplifying go without saying...
