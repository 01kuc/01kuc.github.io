- For math lectures, even more buttons are required for adding content fast and seamlessly. For instance, quite often, I will need to add _Definitions_ and _Theorems_ with their respective mathematical expressions.

- Add a pop up for the delete buttons and ask whether I am sure or not! It is so easy to delete a content I have been working on :( 


- Some simple markdown syntax are still not working. Indentify and fix them

- Graphing functions needs improvements...

- Graph functions simply do not support (afaic) vectoral drawings. Could it be enhances easily?
