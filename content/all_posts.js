I will fix them later by using RegEx functions.\n\n###Issues\n\nOrdered lists, blockquotes and some other features are not working. Because during the converting process of this markdown post to hyperscript, whitespaces that surround special markdown syntax (such as bold chars \\*text\\*) [dissappear](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15721373/how-do-i-ensure-that-whitespace-is-preserved-in-markdown). This results in **bold**, _italic text_, or links that are sticked to the words before and after them. \n\nAs a workaround, before converting this markdown, I replace all white space with the HTML entity for white space, the `nbsp` characters. \n\nHowever, since I am using bootstrap to add some simple styling to the page, long text in a narrow page does not get wrapped up and it goes on horizontally. Why does CSS fails to wrap the words correctly? Because there are no more white spaces! A CSS attribute such as `word-wrap:break-all` works fine, but it breaks in the middle of the word, which is not good.\n\nThis is why after converting the markdown to hyperscript, I replace the `nbsp ` characters back to good old white spaces. Apparently, this is breaking some of the markdown's native features... \n\nヾ( ￣O￣)ツ\n\nOkay... Here are some styles that are _not_ **broken**...
